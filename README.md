# Thanks Sir. sentdex with his tutorial "How to use your trained model - Deep Learning basics with Python, TensorFlow and Keras" 
tensorflow model 
The Project use training data from website https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765. It will be divided into 
3 steps 

Step 1: Read file from folder. Create training data : convert data to numpy array and normalize data. Save the training data file 
to pickle file. 

Step 2: Using Convolutional Neural Networks to clasify dogs and cats with the dataset we  built in previous Step. Save model to 
cat_dog.model . 

Step 3: Get grayscaled, resized, and reshaped test image and use the model cat_dog to make a prediction.
